Types of Machine Learning

- Supervised 
- Unsupervised

## Supervised Machine Learning

Here, we feed labelled data as a input to the Machine Learning model.The input and output value is already known, and the machine learning algorithm learns the mapping function. Mathematically, for Y as the Output/dependent variable and X as the input/independent variable, machine learning algorithms try to find the best mapping function f such that Y = f(X).

### Supervised learning can be further categorized as
1. Classification
2. Regression

Some famous use cases of Supervised Learning are :
- Object detection and Classification
- Recommendation
- Time Series prediction.

Some Frequently used algorithms in Supervised Learning :
- Linear & Logistic Regression
- SVM (Support Vector Machines)
- Random Forest

## Unsupervised Machine Learning

Unsupervised learning is a category of machine learning in which we only have the input data fed to the model but no corresponding output data.Machine learning algorithms find the function that finds similarity among different input data instances and groups them based on the similarity index, which is the output of unsupervised learning.

### Unsupervised Learning can further be categorized as :
1. Clustering (Unsupervised classification)
2. Association

Some famous use cases of Unsupervised Learning are :
- Market Segmentation
- Fraud detection
- Image Segmentation

Some Frequently used algorithms in Unsupervised Learning :
- K-means
- Apriori Algorithm for learning association rule.
